    "html": "\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<p>An experienced Oregon education specialist whose sister serves in the Oregon House is seeking to unseat one of the most influential moderate Democrats in the Senate.</p><p>Education consultant Myrna Muñoz, related to Rep. Lesly Muñoz, D-Woodburn, announced on social media last week that she’ll run in the Democratic primary Oregon’s 15th Senate District, challenging Sen. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro. The Washington County district encompasses much of the city of Hillsboro, as well as Forest Grove, Cornelius and the Rock Creek area.</p><p>Muñoz pointed to her ties to local immigrant farm working communities while noting that she was running to improve civil rights for everyone, fully fund public schools and ensure health care as a right for all.</p><p>“SD 15 deserves a senator who fights for working families and believes in our shared future,” she wrote in a caption for her announcement video. “We have 96 days. Together, we can win this.”</p><p>Muñoz enters the race with fewer resources than Sollman, who also serves as the Senate assistant majority leader. State campaign finance records show that Sollman’s campaign has more than $210,000 in the bank, while no figures or campaign account statements were available for Muñoz as of Monday. Candidates have 30 days after a transaction to report contributions or spending, and that window narrows to seven days close to an election.</p><p>Muñoz began serving as education specialist supporting English learners with the Oregon Department of Education in January. Meanwhile, she has also been a self-employed executive director of a multilingual education education consultant group since February 2022, as well as working with the Oregon Department of Education from 2023 to 2024 to advise on multilingual and migrant education, according to her Linkedin. She also worked as an adjunct instructor at Portland State University from 2016 to 2023.</p><p>In an interview, Muñoz described herself as a life-long educator, strong supporter of unions and someone who never planned to pursue elected office, aside from assisting her sister’s campaigns. She considers herself a progressive and said she had previously been in touch with Sollman’s campaign, adding that the senator had once helped her acquire a business license.</p><p>But she said there has been widespread dissatisfaction with Sollman’s leadership in the district and that she “wasn’t feeling very represented by the things that she was moving forward with.” She pointed to Sollman’s work on data centers as well as her response to concerns about aggressive immigration enforcement at a Jan. 30 town hall alongside Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield.</p><p>“I honestly got quite passionate about the data centers Senator Sollman was bringing in, and also she joined Attorney General Rayfield’s town hall,” Munoz said. “When people from my community I grew up in…were explaining how fearful they are about what’s happening with ICE, her response was, I would say, lacking compassion.”</p><p>While Sollman is a lead sponsor on Senate Bill 1586, which would double the length of property tax breaks for a program data centers often take advantage of in Oregon, she told The Oregonian/OregonLive.com that she will be stripping the legislation of that provision in a forthcoming amendment. The bill had a public hearing Monday and will receive another one on Wednesday in the Senate Finance and Revenue Committee.</p><p>Sollman declined an interview Monday, saying that she was proud to represent a community she grew up in and suggesting that she would be more focused on the election after the end of lawmakers’ short 35-day legislative session.</p><p>In a written statement later Monday, she said the economic development bill would prohibit stand-alone data centers and retail warehouses. She noted that she was a chief co-sponsor of a law passed last year that requires major energy users, such as data centers or cryptocurrency operations, to pay for their impact on Oregon’s electric grid. She also pointed to her remarks alongside Gov. Tina Kotek on Jan. 24 where she and other leaders denounced the federal government’s immigration enforcement policies.</p><p>“Based on feedback from previous events, lawmakers committed to doing more listening and less talking, particularly on local issues. To make space for as many voices as possible, I focused on hearing from attendees rather than responding individually during the session,” she said of her participation in the town hall. “It was heartbreaking to hear the fear that has rippled through the community. We are experiencing a humanitarian crisis.”</p><p>Sollman has held her position in the Senate since 2022, after previously serving in the Oregon House since 2017. She has developed a reputation as a more industry-friendly Democrat, at times voting with Republicans against a majority of Democrats. For instance in 2025, she voted against a bill that would have made large tech corporations pay for aggregating local journalism outlets’ content, as well as a new law that made Oregon the first state in the nation to offer unemployment benefits to striking public and private sector employees.</p><p>Most recently, Sollman was a target of a union-backed campaign to pressure moderate Democrats in the lead-up to the session, hoping to get them to completely disconnect state tax code from the federal tax code and subsequently reconnect. Democrats have instead moved forward with legislation to instead only partially split from the federal tax code, passing the legislation in the Oregon Senate on Monday. Sen. Mark Meek, D-Gladstone, was the only Democrat to vote against the bill.</p><p>Muñoz could seek to draw upon support from some of the state’s largest unions, who are major donors to Democratic leadership in Salem, to boost her campaign. Asked about that possibility, she said she is currently holding interviews and meeting with stakeholders to earn endorsements.</p><p>Muñoz has a campaign kick-off event set for March 1, for which she said details will be forthcoming. The primary election is May 19.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared in the <a href=\"https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com\">Oregon Capital Chronicle</a> and is republished here under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.

The advisory runs through 4 a.m. Friday.</p>\n\n<p>The National Weather Service expects 2 to 7 inches of snow in those areas through Wednesday night, with another 1 to 3 inches Thursday into Thursday night. Roads, bridges and overpasses in the advisory zone will likely become slick and hazardous, the NWS said.</p>\n\n<p>Drivers on Highway 6 toward Tillamook and Highway 26 over the Coast Range should plan for winter conditions and carry chains. Snow had accumulated on Highway 6 at Lees Camp Tuesday morning, but had melted by the afternoon.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #f0f4ff; border-left: 4px solid #1a56db; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 24px 0; border-radius: 4px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 8px 0; font-weight: bold; color: #1a56db;\">❄️ Winter Weather Advisory in effect</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">The NWS has issued a winter weather advisory for the North and Central Oregon Coast Range, including areas near Timber, Glenwood and Buxton. <a href=\"https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=ORZ106&warncounty=ORC067&firewxzone=ORZ682&local_place1=5%20Miles%20NW%20Glenwood%20OR&product1=Winter+Weather+Advisory&lat=45.6927&lon=-123.355\" style=\"color: #1a56db; text-decoration: underline;\">Click here to read the full advisory from the National Weather Service.</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Valley snow also possible</h2>\n\n<p>Lower elevations, including Banks and Forest Grove, could also see accumulating snow. The NWS said Tuesday there is a 40 to 65 percent chance of several inches of snow somewhere in the Willamette Valley and Portland metro between 5 p.m. Wednesday and noon Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>The exact location of the heaviest snow depends on the track of a surface low pressure system. The most likely scenario would bring accumulating snow from Corvallis through Salem to the Portland and Vancouver metro, which would include the Forest Grove and Banks area. Other possible tracks could shift the band north or south.</p>\n\n<p>The NWS urged residents to stay tuned as the forecast becomes clearer.</p>\n\n<h2>Winter driving tips</h2>\n\n<p>The National Weather Service recommends keeping a winter emergency kit in your vehicle, including a flashlight, batteries, blankets, a shovel, water, non-perishable food and tire chains.</p>\n\n<p>For current road conditions in Oregon, call 511 or visit <a href=\"https://tripcheck.com/\">tripcheck.com</a>.</p>\n\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Photo by Blake Timm.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The Rotary Club of Forest Grove recognized five students from three school districts as Youth Citizens of the Month at its January and February meetings.</p>\n\n<p>Four Forest Grove School District students were honored Jan. 28: Conan Moore of Neil Armstrong Middle School, Marisa Calvillo of Forest Grove High School, and Rhyli Mason and Isabelle Swendig of Tuality Plains High School. At the February meeting, the club honored Evalyn Fordyce of Gaston Junior/Senior High School.</p>\n\n<h2>January</h2>\n\n<p>Moore, an eighth grader, was praised by counselor Susan Lee for his reading and writing skills, analytical thinking and dependability. “He’s kind, helpful, hardworking, humorous and inquisitive,” Lee told club members, according to a press release.</p>\n\n<p>Calvillo, a senior, earned College Board honors while playing soccer and lacrosse and holding down a part-time job. She also spent two summers as a peer tutor. “This type of selfless attitude and willingness to help others is one of the many traits Marisa exhibits,” said Assistant Principal Doug Thompson.</p>\n\n<p>Mason, a student at Tuality Plains, balances her coursework with caring for her young son. Teacher Christy Crisman said Mason “manages her dual roles with grace” and has “a deep-seated kindness that enriches our school community.”</p>\n\n<p>Isabelle “Izzy” Swendig, also a student at Tuality Plains, is an aspiring kindergarten teacher. Crisman described her as “compassionate, dependable and deeply respectful of others.”</p>\n\n<h2>February</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\">\n<img src=\"https://www.newsinthegrove.com/content/images/2026/02/rotary-youth-citizen-feb2026.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Rotary president with student honoree and her mother\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption>Rotary Club of Forest Grove President Andrea Stewart, left, with February Youth Citizen of the Month Evalyn Fordyce of Gaston Jr./Sr. High School and her mother, Laura Fordyce. Photo by John Schrag.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The February meeting had an unusual twist: Gaston counselor Laura Fordyce introduced the honoree: her own daughter, Evalyn, an eighth grader.</p>\n\n<p>The elder Fordyce said she’s been most gratified watching her daughter’s concern for others in the small district, which enrolls just under 500 students. “She looks out for the little guy,” she said. “The student who needs a friend, who needs to be welcomed into a new school.”</p>\n\n<p>Counselor Kathy Cooper called Fordyce “a shining example of what it means to be a responsible and caring member of our school community.”</p>\n\n<p>A second Gaston honoree was unable to attend and will be recognized at a later date, the club said.</p>\n\n<p>The Youth Citizen of the Month program rotates between the Forest Grove, Banks and Gaston school districts, honoring eighth graders and seniors for citizenship and character. Each honoree received a certificate and a $50 gift card from Frye’s Action Athletics.</p>\n\n<h2>Rotary Global Scholarship open until March 1</h2>\n\n<p>Rotary District 5100 is accepting applications for a 2026-2027 Global Grant Scholarship, which provides up to $30,000 annually for graduate-level study abroad aligned with Rotary’s areas of focus, including peacebuilding, disease prevention, water and sanitation, and environmental protection.</p>\n\n<p>The district selects one candidate each year. Applicants must have admission to a foreign academic institution and speak the language of instruction.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://rotarydistrict5100.org/global-scholars\">rotarydistrict5100.org/global-scholars</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:RD5100GlobalScholars@gmail.com\">RD5100GlobalScholars@gmail.com</a>.

Same-day reservations will be available but are not recommended due to limited cell service in the area. Camping fees remain $20 per night.</p><p>“We are making the change to a reservation-only campground for two main reasons,” said Oregon Department of Forestry State Forests Recreation Facilities Manager Ben Burns. “First, it benefits our campers. When you load up your toy hauler for a weekend trip, it’s reassuring to know you’ll have a campsite waiting when you arrive. This system eliminates the frustration of driving around the campground hoping to find an open site.”</p><p>The change follows what the department said was a successful rollout of reservation systems at state forest equestrian campgrounds in 2025. ODF says the system will also free up staff time that was previously spent on fee collection.</p><p>The group camping area at Browns Camp already uses reservations and will remain unchanged.</p><p>ODF is also converting the Diamond Mill OHV Area into a campground, expected to open for the 2026 season.</p><p>“We are actively working on that project, and it will be ready to roll out for the 2026 season,” said Burns.</p><p>Reservations open March 2 at <a href=\"https://www.reserveamerica.com\">reserveamerica.com</a>.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Email us!</a>\n</div></div></div>\n\n<p>Starting this week, you'll be getting <strong>two newsletters</strong> from News in the Grove instead of one, and here's why.</p>\n<p>Our weekly newsletter has been growing. More stories, more events, more community news, which is a great problem to have. But it also means our emails have gotten long enough that many email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) have started <strong>clipping</strong> them. If you've ever seen a \"View entire message\" link at the bottom of our newsletter, that's what's happening. Your email provider is cutting off the rest.</p>\n<p>Rather than trimming our coverage, we're giving you <strong>two focused newsletters</strong> each week:</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday: Events Newsletter</strong><br>Everything happening in and around the Grove. Meetings, markets, performances, fundraisers, and community gatherings. Your midweek planning guide.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday: News Newsletter</strong><br>The week's stories, features, and Around Town updates. All the news, no event listings to scroll past.</p>\n<p>You don't need to do anything. You'll automatically receive both editions. And each one will be short enough to actually land in your inbox in full.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading,<br>Chas Hundley</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.newsinthegrove.com/events/#/\">Find all

The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife waives the requirements for a fishing license, combined angling tag, Columbia Basin endorsement, ocean endorsement, and two-rod validation during free fishing weekends.</p><p>All other regulations still apply, including area closures and bag limits. Anglers should check current regulations at <a href=\"https://myodfw.com\">myodfw.com</a> before heading out, particularly for salmon and steelhead, as rules change seasonally.</p><p>While some family-friendly events are scheduled to coincide with Free Fishing Weekends, none had been published by press time.</p><p>Hagg Lake is expected to be stocked the week of Feb. 9 - 13 with 1,000 trophy trout—trout that are at least 15 inches—in advance of the event. The Oregon Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife does not publish exact stocking dates.</p><p>Two more free fishing weekends are scheduled for 2026: June 6-7 and November 27-28 (Thanksgiving weekend).</p>",

    "slug": "superintendent-links-federal-immigration-enforcement-to-student-withdrawals-warns-of-staff-reductions",
    "html": "<p>In a mid-year update to the Forest Grove School Board, Superintendent Suzanne West said the district faced layoffs and that federal immigration enforcement is believed to be driving a spike in student withdrawals from the district.</p><p>Since school began for the year in September, 207 students have withdrawn from a school. Forty of those withdrawals were in-district, meaning a student left for a different school in the Forest Grove School District, West said during her presentation. She said just under 300 students withdrew from the district last year, and believes the district is on track to surpass that number this year.</p><p>Some transfers are expected every year; students leave the district because they have moved, graduate early, drop out, opt to homeschool or attend a private school, for example.</p><p>One hundred thirty-nine of the 207 student withdrawals are Latino, according to a slide West displayed to the board. According to Oregon Department of Education data from the 2024-25 school year, the most recent data available, 59% of students in the district were Hispanic or Latino.</p><p>\"Immigration enforcement has significantly impacted us,\" West said. \"We've had a lot of students leave.\"</p><p>She added that attendance rates have also dropped due to fears over immigration enforcement.</p><p>\"We're several percentage points higher in our absence rates than we were for the same period of time last year,\" she said. \"Even more than that, the fear and the stress and the anxiety that this is causing in our community, it does have an impact on students and staff in our schools,\" she said.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">📹</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsxxQxx0PiA\">Watch the full presentation online</a>.</div></div><p>West described a ripple effect of fear and uncertainty that went beyond enrollment and attendance, describing negative impacts to staff well-being and student learning.</p><p>\"As a community, I suspect we will be feeling it for a generation. I don't think this is going to end soon. I think we're in it for the long haul, and the long term effects of what staff and students are feeling, we won't know the full effect of that for many years.\"</p><p>West said student absences were appearing in district data and that she expects the district to fall short of targeted Longitudinal Performance Growth Targets (LPGTs).</p><p>LPGTs are targets set by districts in conjunction with the Oregon Department of Education; they track metrics like on-time graduation rates, math and reading proficiency, and attendance.</p><p>\"Those metrics that the state expects of us, I've already psychologically prepared myself that we're not going to hit all of them, as hard as everyone's working,\" West said.</p><p><strong>Staff reduction 'seems inevitable'</strong></p><p>When the district adopts a budget in June, it's likely that some teachers and staff will lose their jobs, West said.</p><p>West said staff reductions were likely due to a combination of reductions forecast by the Oregon Legislature, uncertainty about federal funding, lost revenue from lower student enrollment and costs rising faster than money coming into the district.</p><p>\"We likely are going to have to make some staff reductions. We will do everything we can to not impact people, but at this point, given the projections, I don't know how we will get away with not reducing positions,\" West said. She promised further updates as the budget process advanced.</p><p>\"But it seems inevitable at this point,\" she added.</p><p><strong>Teaching quality, professional learning inconsistent</strong></p><p>Earlier in her presentation, West praised district staff and families.</p><p>\"I am blown away by the commitment by our educators, our administrators, our support staff, our families and their commitment to their kids' education, it's remarkable.\"</p><p>West said teachers and leaders in the Forest Grove School District need to learn how to do their jobs better.</p><p>She described the need for instruction to improve as urgent.</p><p>\"One thing that has become abundantly clear to me is that we need a real deep dive on professional learning in this district. We need to dig deep into instruction and reset some instructional practices,\" she said.</p><p>West said some of that work has begun.</p><p>\"Everybody is working hard, and doing what they absolutely believe is right for kids but that effort has not been supported with the kind of professional learning that allows us to accelerate change through the system,\" West said. She said change would be coming over the next couple of years to address this.</p><p>\"As I have observed in classrooms, I've noticed inconsistency in instructional quality, inconsistency in alignment and inconsistency in the use of data,\" she said.</p><p>\"That's on us. That's a leadership problem. That is not a teacher problem, so that is something that we need to be fixed,\" she said.</p><p>West said the district is seeing \"pockets of growth,\" but that it would take a while for those results to take root.</p><p>\"Change takes time, new habits take time, practices take time,\" she said.</p>",

She has 20 years of experience in nonprofit leadership and management.</p><p>\"I hope to bring that nonprofit and rural leadership perspective to strengthen the capacity of heritage organizations, reduce barriers for smaller and under-resourced groups, and help ensure that more Oregonians see their stories reflected in our shared heritage,\" Tracewell said.</p><p>Tracewell served as president of the Rotary Club of Forest Grove in 2023-24 and has been a Rotarian since 2003.
