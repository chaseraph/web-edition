      <div class="story-body has-dropcap">
        <p>A winter weather advisory is now in effect for the Coast Range foothills, including higher-elevation communities west of Banks such as Timber, Glenwood and Buxton. The advisory runs through 4 a.m. Friday.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service expects 2 to 7 inches of snow in those areas through Wednesday night, with another 1 to 3 inches Thursday into Thursday night. Roads, bridges and overpasses in the advisory zone will likely become slick and hazardous, the NWS said.</p>

<p>Drivers on Highway 6 toward Tillamook and Highway 26 over the Coast Range should plan for winter conditions and carry chains. Snow had accumulated on Highway 6 at Lees Camp Tuesday morning, but had melted by the afternoon.</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">The NWS has issued a winter weather advisory for the North and Central Oregon Coast Range, including areas near Timber, Glenwood and Buxton. <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=ORZ106&warncounty=ORC067&firewxzone=ORZ682&local_place1=5%20Miles%20NW%20Glenwood%20OR&product1=Winter+Weather+Advisory&lat=45.6927&lon=-123.355" style="color: #1a56db; text-decoration: underline;">Click here to read the full advisory from the National Weather Service.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Valley snow also possible</h2>

<p>Lower elevations, including Banks and Forest Grove, could also see accumulating snow. The NWS said Tuesday there is a 40 to 65 percent chance of several inches of snow somewhere in the Willamette Valley and Portland metro between 5 p.m. Wednesday and noon Thursday.</p>

<p>The exact location of the heaviest snow depends on the track of a surface low pressure system. The most likely scenario would bring accumulating snow from Corvallis through Salem to the Portland and Vancouver metro, which would include the Forest Grove and Banks area. Other possible tracks could shift the band north or south.</p>

<p>The NWS urged residents to stay tuned as the forecast becomes clearer.</p>

<h2>Winter driving tips</h2>

<p>The National Weather Service recommends keeping a winter emergency kit in your vehicle, including a flashlight, batteries, blankets, a shovel, water, non-perishable food and tire chains.</p>

<p>The Rotary Club of Forest Grove recognized five students from three school districts as Youth Citizens of the Month at its January and February meetings.</p>

<p>Four Forest Grove School District students were honored Jan. 28: Conan Moore of Neil Armstrong Middle School, Marisa Calvillo of Forest Grove High School, and Rhyli Mason and Isabelle Swendig of Tuality Plains High School. At the February meeting, the club honored Evalyn Fordyce of Gaston Junior/Senior High School.</p>

<h2>January</h2>

<p>Moore, an eighth grader, was praised by counselor Susan Lee for his reading and writing skills, analytical thinking and dependability. “He’s kind, helpful, hardworking, humorous and inquisitive,” Lee told club members, according to a press release.</p>

<p>Calvillo, a senior, earned College Board honors while playing soccer and lacrosse and holding down a part-time job. She also spent two summers as a peer tutor. “This type of selfless attitude and willingness to help others is one of the many traits Marisa exhibits,” said Assistant Principal Doug Thompson.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">“a shining example of what it means to be a responsible and caring member of our school community.”</blockquote>


<p>Mason, a student at Tuality Plains, balances her coursework with caring for her young son. Teacher Christy Crisman said Mason “manages her dual roles with grace” and has “a deep-seated kindness that enriches our school community.”</p>

<p>Isabelle “Izzy” Swendig, also a student at Tuality Plains, is an aspiring kindergarten teacher. Crisman described her as “compassionate, dependable and deeply respectful of others.”</p>

<h2>February</h2>

</figure>

<p>The February meeting had an unusual twist: Gaston counselor Laura Fordyce introduced the honoree: her own daughter, Evalyn, an eighth grader.</p>

<p>The elder Fordyce said she’s been most gratified watching her daughter’s concern for others in the small district, which enrolls just under 500 students. “She looks out for the little guy,” she said. “The student who needs a friend, who needs to be welcomed into a new school.”</p>

<p>Counselor Kathy Cooper called Fordyce “a shining example of what it means to be a responsible and caring member of our school community.”</p>

<p>A second Gaston honoree was unable to attend and will be recognized at a later date, the club said.</p>

<p>The Youth Citizen of the Month program rotates between the Forest Grove, Banks and Gaston school districts, honoring eighth graders and seniors for citizenship and character. Each honoree received a certificate and a $50 gift card from Frye’s Action Athletics.</p>

<h2>Rotary Global Scholarship open until March 1</h2>

<p>Rotary District 5100 is accepting applications for a 2026-2027 Global Grant Scholarship, which provides up to $30,000 annually for graduate-level study abroad aligned with Rotary’s areas of focus, including peacebuilding, disease prevention, water and sanitation, and environmental protection.</p>

      <div class="story-body has-dropcap">
        <p>Browns Camp Campground in the Tillamook State Forest is switching to a reservation-only system when it reopens April 1.</p><p>The 28-site Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) campground, previously first-come, first-served, will require advance booking through reserveamerica.com starting March 2. Same-day reservations will be available but are not recommended due to limited cell service in the area. Camping fees remain $20 per night.</p><p>“We are making the change to a reservation-only campground for two main reasons,” said Oregon Department of Forestry State Forests Recreation Facilities Manager Ben Burns. “First, it benefits our campers. When you load up your toy hauler for a weekend trip, it’s reassuring to know you’ll have a campsite waiting when you arrive. This system eliminates the frustration of driving around the campground hoping to find an open site.”</p><p>The change follows what the department said was a successful rollout of reservation systems at state forest equestrian campgrounds in 2025. ODF says the system will also free up staff time that was previously spent on fee collection.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">“We are making the change to a reservation-only campground for two main reasons,”<cite>— Ben Burns</cite></blockquote>
<p>The group camping area at Browns Camp already uses reservations and will remain unchanged.</p><p>ODF is also converting the Diamond Mill OHV Area into a campground, expected to open for the 2026 season.</p><p>“We are actively working on that project, and it will be ready to roll out for the 2026 season,” said Burns.</p><p>Reservations open March 2 at <a href="https://www.reserveamerica.com">reserveamerica.com</a>.</p>

<p>Visits to the Banks-Vernonia State Trail and L.L. "Stub" Stewart State Park both declined in 2025, mirroring a statewide trend that saw Oregon's park system dip slightly from record-breaking numbers the year before.</p>

<p>The Banks-Vernonia State Trail recorded an estimated 109,050 day-use visits in 2025, down about 14% from 127,313 in 2024. The 21-mile rail trail, which connects the cities of Banks and Vernonia through the foothills of the northern Coast Range, has seen a gradual decline from a peak of 136,205 visits in 2021.</p>

<p>Stub Stewart State Park saw day-use visits fall to 153,248, down from 250,612 in 2024 — a drop of nearly 39%. Overnight stays at the park remained relatively steady, with 70,947 camper nights in 2025 compared to 72,782 the year before.</p>

<p>Day-use fees at the park and others across the state doubled in 2025, requiring visitors to shell out $10 to park at the park.</p>

  <p style="margin:0">Oregon state parks welcomed 51.46 million day-use visits in 2025, down from a record 53.85 million in 2024. Willamette Valley parks — which include Banks-Vernonia and Stub Stewart — dropped from 11.44M to 10.71M. Central and Eastern Oregon parks bucked the trend, rising to 10.09M.</p>

<p>The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department does not receive general fund tax dollars and relies on user fees, a portion of Oregon State Lottery revenue, and a share of recreational vehicle registration fees. The agency is navigating a projected budget shortfall.</p>

<p>"Even with small year to year changes in visitation, the love people have for Oregon State Parks is clear," said Interim Director Stefanie Coons. "We want to do everything we can to continue to provide high quality experiences and create treasured memories for our visitors."</p>

      <div class="story-body has-dropcap">
        <p>An experienced Oregon education specialist whose sister serves in the Oregon House is seeking to unseat one of the most influential moderate Democrats in the Senate.</p><p>Education consultant Myrna Muñoz, related to Rep. Lesly Muñoz, D-Woodburn, announced on social media last week that she’ll run in the Democratic primary Oregon’s 15th Senate District, challenging Sen. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro. The Washington County district encompasses much of the city of Hillsboro, as well as Forest Grove, Cornelius and the Rock Creek area.</p><p>Muñoz pointed to her ties to local immigrant farm working communities while noting that she was running to improve civil rights for everyone, fully fund public schools and ensure health care as a right for all.</p><p>“SD 15 deserves a senator who fights for working families and believes in our shared future,” she wrote in a caption for her announcement video. “We have 96 days. Together, we can win this.”</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">“wasn’t feeling very represented by the things that she was moving forward with.”</blockquote>
<p>Muñoz enters the race with fewer resources than Sollman, who also serves as the Senate assistant majority leader. State campaign finance records show that Sollman’s campaign has more than $210,000 in the bank, while no figures or campaign account statements were available for Muñoz as of Monday. Candidates have 30 days after a transaction to report contributions or spending, and that window narrows to seven days close to an election.</p><p>Muñoz began serving as education specialist supporting English learners with the Oregon Department of Education in January. Meanwhile, she has also been a self-employed executive director of a multilingual education education consultant group since February 2022, as well as working with the Oregon Department of Education from 2023 to 2024 to advise on multilingual and migrant education, according to her Linkedin. She also worked as an adjunct instructor at Portland State University from 2016 to 2023.</p><p>In an interview, Muñoz described herself as a life-long educator, strong supporter of unions and someone who never planned to pursue elected office, aside from assisting her sister’s campaigns. She considers herself a progressive and said she had previously been in touch with Sollman’s campaign, adding that the senator had once helped her acquire a business license.</p><p>But she said there has been widespread dissatisfaction with Sollman’s leadership in the district and that she “wasn’t feeling very represented by the things that she was moving forward with.” She pointed to Sollman’s work on data centers as well as her response to concerns about aggressive immigration enforcement at a Jan. 30 town hall alongside Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield.</p><p>“I honestly got quite passionate about the data centers Senator Sollman was bringing in, and also she joined Attorney General Rayfield’s town hall,” Munoz said. “When people from my community I grew up in…were explaining how fearful they are about what’s happening with ICE, her response was, I would say, lacking compassion.”</p><p>While Sollman is a lead sponsor on Senate Bill 1586, which would double the length of property tax breaks for a program data centers often take advantage of in Oregon, she told The Oregonian/OregonLive.com that she will be stripping the legislation of that provision in a forthcoming amendment. The bill had a public hearing Monday and will receive another one on Wednesday in the Senate Finance and Revenue Committee.</p><p>Sollman declined an interview Monday, saying that she was proud to represent a community she grew up in and suggesting that she would be more focused on the election after the end of lawmakers’ short 35-day legislative session.</p><p>In a written statement later Monday, she said the economic development bill would prohibit stand-alone data centers and retail warehouses. She noted that she was a chief co-sponsor of a law passed last year that requires major energy users, such as data centers or cryptocurrency operations, to pay for their impact on Oregon’s electric grid. She also pointed to her remarks alongside Gov. Tina Kotek on Jan. 24 where she and other leaders denounced the federal government’s immigration enforcement policies.</p><p>“Based on feedback from previous events, lawmakers committed to doing more listening and less talking, particularly on local issues. To make space for as many voices as possible, I focused on hearing from attendees rather than responding individually during the session,” she said of her participation in the town hall. “It was heartbreaking to hear the fear that has rippled through the community. We are experiencing a humanitarian crisis.”</p><p>Sollman has held her position in the Senate since 2022, after previously serving in the Oregon House since 2017. She has developed a reputation as a more industry-friendly Democrat, at times voting with Republicans against a majority of Democrats. For instance in 2025, she voted against a bill that would have made large tech corporations pay for aggregating local journalism outlets’ content, as well as a new law that made Oregon the first state in the nation to offer unemployment benefits to striking public and private sector employees.</p><p>Most recently, Sollman was a target of a union-backed campaign to pressure moderate Democrats in the lead-up to the session, hoping to get them to completely disconnect state tax code from the federal tax code and subsequently reconnect. Democrats have instead moved forward with legislation to instead only partially split from the federal tax code, passing the legislation in the Oregon Senate on Monday. Sen. Mark Meek, D-Gladstone, was the only Democrat to vote against the bill.</p><p>Muñoz could seek to draw upon support from some of the state’s largest unions, who are major donors to Democratic leadership in Salem, to boost her campaign. Asked about that possibility, she said she is currently holding interviews and meeting with stakeholders to earn endorsements.</p><p>Muñoz has a campaign kick-off event set for March 1, for which she said details will be forthcoming. The primary election is May 19.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared in the <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com">Oregon Capital Chronicle</a> and is republished here under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.
